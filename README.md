FluentShellUnit is a framework to execute unit tests in C# for testing PowerShell modules and scripts. FluentShellUnit is the only powershell testing framework written in C#, that allows you to stub any cmdlet or functions in a module using a scriptblock that can simulate the behaviour of the cmdlet or function. FluentShellUnit helps developers maintain the PowerShell projects in Visual studio IDE and execute tests as part of the build process, thus bringing the teams one step closer to CI.
